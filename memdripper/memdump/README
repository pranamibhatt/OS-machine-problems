			Memdump module release note V 1.0.0
			-------------------------------------

INTRODUCTION:
--------------

Basically this module can be used for debugging a user application in runtime
User can selectively dump the code/data/heap/stack segment of the running 
user process.

HOW TO BUILD THE MODULE 
------------------------

In this version module can be built only as inbuilt module to kernel,So for 
selecting that user can follow the below steps.

1. Run "make menuconfig" command from MCA_Kernel directory

2. Enable MemDump Support in the follwing location
 
  │ Prompt: Enable debug code (memory dumper)                                                                                                                       │  
  │   Defined at memdump/Kconfig:3                                                                                                                                  │  
  │   Depends on: MACH_KZMA9 [=y]                                                                                                                                   │

  │     -> Device Drivers                                                                                                                                           │  
  │       -> MemDump Support                                                                                                                                        │  

3. save and exit 

4. Give a "make"
 
5.Copy the uImage and boot kzma9 card with this 

CHECKING MODULE VALIDITY 
------------------------

1.You can ensure the module is properly inserted into kernel
by running follwoing command

# cat > /proc/memdump

If mdoule properly inserted it will return 

Hi Memdump V 1.0.0 alive!

DUMPING PROCESS SEGMENTS
--------------------------
1.User can run following command in target card for dumping the 
process segments.

# echo <pid> <seg_to_dump> /proc/memdump

ex: if you want to dump of application pid 213 

then run like
	
#echo 213 code > /proc/memdump
	
OUTPUT
-----
if pid is valid you will get the segment dump under 

/tmp/<process_name>_<seg_name>_time_stamp format.

other wise you will get kernel error

VERIFICATION
------------
for verification of this dump,we can either use gdb or objdump

1.run objdump <process_name> it will list all the segments in your 
  process and you can cross check verify the value in that dump from
  memdump
2.Run the process in gdb as like below 

  #gbd <process_name>
  #(gdb) x  < value_of_addr_needed>

verify this value with memdump value 

SUPPORTED PLATFORM
----------------
V 1.0.0 of memdump support x86 and arm architecture
